5) There is neither a discussion section nor a references page.

6) Correctness of the singleton / couple sweep has not been established.
==================================================

Other than fixing those, I have confidence that the following can be added to the paper by January 14th

A) Two dimensional seating arrangements can be treated as one dimensional if we assign each seat to be either a singleton or a couple seat before running the sweep.  Such an assignment algorithm is emerging from the murkiness of my brain at the moment.

B) We can optimally solve families of size 3 using a slight variant of the sweep swap algorithm. 

C) Because each exchange makes 0-2 people happy, it should be rather easy to come up with a simple 2 approximation, at least on the line.
